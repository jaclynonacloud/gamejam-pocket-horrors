## Ideas
### Surviving a Meeting
All of your coworkers are monsters.  If you don't learn their killing mechanics, you'll never survive this meeting...
### Walking to your Car
You work at a mall.  It's late.  Time to go to your car.  Uh-oh, something is chasing you.  Hope you can survive long enough to make it to your car.
### Returning the Doll
You are a hideous monster that lives at a carnival.  A little girl has dropped her doll.  You must return it, even if  you have to risk danger from the other humans.
### Bug Smacking
You smack what looks like a harmless bug on your wall. It multiplies, growing uglier.  You smack it again.  There are now many bugs on your wall... Can you successfully rid your room of these invasive, horrific insects?
### Maintaining the Garden
Your friend is out of town; they want you to check on their plants. It's midnight.  You're a good friend and do it.  They give you specific instructions.  You soon learn why.
### Infected Forest
You are a lumberjack.  Your job is not easy.  It's up to you to stop gore from spreading through the woods and into the city.  Ration your tools until the forest is clean again.
### Dating Simulator
I dunno.  Dating sim gone spooky???
### Raising Horror Monsters
You are helping raise horror monsters into their full, uncanny potential.  Take care of their growing needs!
### Cleaning the House
You are employed to clean someone's house.  Their twin children are creepy and following you around.
### Pokemon but Horror
I like this.  I like this a lot.  Battle until your monster is the largest.  Inherits traits from every won battle.
